# CountLines
CLOC : Count Lines Of Code

Written in BASIC, CLOC is a command line program which counts blank lines, comment lines and physical lines of code in 17 programming and scripting languages:
* Ada, ASM, Awk, BASIC, C and C++, Charm, Forth, Fortran77, Lisp, Lua, Makefile, Obey and TaskObey, Pascal, Python, Squeak.

It provides statistics on the numbers of blank lines, comment lines and code lines in files that it recognises as these language files.


# Installation

To install CLOC, simply place the BASIC file "cloc" in the library directory (Usually !Boot.Library, or under RISCOS 4: !Boot.Library.User).

If you are using RISCOS 4 then put the text file "cloc" in directory "RISCOS4" into the Library Help directory: !Boot.Library.User.Help.

For information on how to use the program see the Help file.
